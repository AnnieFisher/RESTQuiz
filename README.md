# RESTQuiz

This is a quiz created with Spring MVC, JPA entities, mySql database, JavaScript, event Listeners, and XMLHttpRequests.
This is the minimimally viable product and needs refactored to incorporate closures to remove the global scope variables.
The html also needs to be made more visibly pleasant. I would also like to add a user interface to create new users. My program
allows the user to create a new quiz name, edit the quiz name, shows the user the score via a prompt, and persists all of this
information to include the scores in the database.

--MVC portion-- Quiz repo contains the JPA aspect of the program.
